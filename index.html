        Design
      </h2>
      <p>
        Over the past four years, I've designed hundreds of parts including
        CNC-machined and snap-fit injection-molded components, As well as
        simpler 3D printed and lasercut parts.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Simulation
      </h2>
      <p>
        From using topology optimization to lightweight parts to using structural
        simulations to narrow down snap fits, I simulate and validate all my
        components in FEA.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Manufacturing
      </h2>
      <p>
        I've written CAM in HSM and Mastercam for dozens of complex
        multi-fixture components in materials like titanium and stainless. I also
        have mass-production experience working with overseas suppliers at
        Apple.

      CWRU Baja Design: Rear Upright
    </h1>
    <div class="bajacontentcontainer">
      <p>
        I completely redesigned our teams rear-upright for manufacturability 
        using a first-principles approach. I effectively cut the part's size 
        in half while maintaining all suspension-related requirements, 
        reducing machining time, stock cost, and overall
        weight.

          <p>
            This part was a 4th axis fixture along with a
            vise fixture. CAM was written in HSM and
            machine time was reduced from ~8 hrs to
            4.

            Nonlinear dynamic simulation of the entire assembly. In order to get more
            accurate results of various wheel impacts, and properly model the bearing stress
            on the upright, I ran FEA on the entire assembly instead of the individual part.

          <p>
            The upright integrates with the rest of the rear suspension assembly, and is
            designed to have zero camber gain over travel.
